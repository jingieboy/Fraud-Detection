# Fraud-Detection
Using Machine Learning Algorithms to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, using the Undersampling method to deal with heavily unbalanced dataset

## Steps
1. Data Exploration
2. Sampling Data
3. Data Preprocessing 
4. Evaluating Machine Learning Models (Scaling, Cross-validation)
